WHAT DISTINGUISHES NORMAL HTML ELEMENTS FROM SEMANTIC HTML ELEMENTS
Normal HTML elements are generic tags like `<div>`, `<span>`, `<p>`, etc., which don't carry specific meaning about their content. Semantic HTML elements, on the other hand, convey meaning about the content they contain. For example, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, etc., provide context and structure to the content, making it more meaningful for both browsers and developers. They help improve accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and code readability.
WHAT IS THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN CLOSING TAGS AND SELF CLOSING TAGS IN HTML
Closing tags are used to mark the end of an HTML element, ensuring proper nesting and structure. For example:
<p>This is a paragraph. </p>
In contrast self-closing tags, also known as void or empty elements, are used to represent elements that don't have any content, such as line breaks, images, or inputs. They don't require a separate closing tag. For example:
<br>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
<input type="text" name="name">
Both types of tags are crucial for creating structured and well-formed HTML documents.
WHAT DISTINGUISHES INLINE ELEMENTS FROM BLOCK ELEMENTS IN HTML
Inline elements and block elements are two types of HTML elements with distinct behaviors and properties:
Inline Elements:
   - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
   - They allow other elements to sit beside them on the same line.
   - Examples of inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<img>`, `<input>`, and `<br>`.
Block Elements:
   - Block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available.
   - They create a visual block that forces subsequent elements to appear on new lines.
   - Examples of block elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`.
Understanding the distinction between inline and block elements is crucial for proper layout and styling in HTML and CSS.
